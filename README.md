# EthLottery

Welcome to _EthLottery_, a decentralized lottery application built on the Ethereum blockchain using [Web3.js](https://web3js.org/) for the backend and [React](https://react.dev/) for the frontend.

**About this Repository**<br />
This project is part of the _[Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/)_ course from [Stephen Grider](https://www.udemy.com/user/sgslo/).<br />
It serves as a demonstrative project illustrating the process of developing, testing, and deploying _Smart Contracts_ within an _Integrated Development Environment_ (IDE), without reliance on [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#lang=en&optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null). Additionally, it showcases how to engage with _Smart Contracts_ through a frontend interface (build with React).
